## 1. Abstract

**HealthVision AI** is an AI-powered web application that uses Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques to detect multiple health conditions from medical images. The system provides three detection modules:

1. **Jaundice Detection** — Analyzes eye/sclera images to detect jaundice by identifying yellow discoloration.
2. **Skin/Face Disease Detection** — Classifies facial skin conditions into 5 categories: Acne, Eczema, Herpes, Panu (Tinea Versicolor), and Rosacea.
3. **Nail Disease Detection** — Identifies nail health conditions across 3 categories: Healthy, Onychomycosis (fungal infection), and Psoriasis.

The application is built using **Flask** (Python web framework), **TensorFlow/Keras** for deep learning model inference, and **OpenCV** for image preprocessing. It features a modern, responsive web interface with both image upload and live camera capture capabilities. The system provides disease information, severity assessment, and medical recommendations for each detected condition.

The latest version also includes an **AI Health Assistant** for structured scan explanation, predefined clinical Q&A, state/district hospital discovery cards, appointment receipt workflow, and chronological chat timeline behavior.

**Keywords:** Deep Learning, CNN, Transfer Learning, Medical Image Classification, Flask, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Healthcare AI

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Background

Healthcare accessibility remains a significant challenge in many parts of the world. Early detection of diseases is crucial for effective treatment, but access to medical professionals is often limited, especially in rural and underserved areas. With advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, it is now possible to develop automated disease detection systems that can provide preliminary health assessments.

### 2.2 Motivation

Skin diseases, jaundice, and nail conditions are among the most common health issues worldwide. Visual inspection is the primary diagnostic method for these conditions, making them ideal candidates for AI-based image analysis. This project aims to bridge the gap between patients and early diagnosis by providing an accessible, AI-powered tool.

### 2.3 Project Overview

HealthVision AI is a comprehensive health detection platform that combines three distinct medical image analysis modules into a single web application. Users can upload images or use their device camera to capture photos, which are then analyzed by trained deep learning models to provide instant health assessments along with detailed medical information.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

Many common health conditions like **jaundice**, **skin diseases**, and **nail disorders** require visual inspection for initial diagnosis. However:

- Access to dermatologists and specialists is limited in rural/remote areas.
- Early symptoms are often ignored due to lack of awareness.
- Manual visual inspection can be subjective and prone to human error.
- Timely diagnosis is critical — delayed treatment worsens outcomes.

**There is a need for an accessible, AI-powered tool that can provide preliminary health assessments from images, enabling early detection and timely medical consultation.**

---

## 4. Objectives

1. To develop a deep learning-based system capable of detecting jaundice from eye/sclera images.
2. To build a facial skin disease classifier that identifies 5 common skin conditions.
3. To create a nail disease detection model that classifies 3 nail health conditions.
4. To integrate all three modules into a single, user-friendly web application.
5. To provide detailed disease information, severity, causes, symptoms, and recommendations.
6. To enable both image upload and real-time camera capture functionality.
7. To provide AI-guided post-screening support with report explanation and hospital discovery.
8. To deploy the application on a cloud platform for online accessibility.

## 5. Literature Review

### 5.1 Deep Learning in Medical Imaging

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized medical image analysis. Research has shown that CNNs can achieve human-level performance in tasks like skin cancer detection (Esteva et al., 2017), diabetic retinopathy screening (Gulshan et al., 2016), and dermatological disease classification.

### 5.2 Transfer Learning

Transfer learning, where pre-trained models (like EfficientNet, MobileNet, ResNet) are fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets, has proven highly effective for medical image classification tasks where labeled data is limited. This approach significantly reduces training time and improves accuracy.

### 5.3 Jaundice Detection via Sclera Analysis

Several studies have explored non-invasive jaundice detection by analyzing the yellow discoloration of the sclera (eye whites). Color space analysis (HSV, LAB) combined with machine learning classifiers has shown promising results for early jaundice screening.

### 5.4 Skin Disease Classification

Automated skin disease classification using CNNs has been widely researched. Models trained on datasets like DermNet, ISIC, and HAM10000 have achieved high accuracy in classifying various dermatological conditions.

### 5.5 Nail Disease Detection

Nail disorders often serve as indicators of both localized and systemic diseases. AI-based nail analysis is an emerging field, with recent studies demonstrating the feasibility of automated detection of conditions like onychomycosis and psoriasis.

### 12.2 Key Code Implementation

#### 12.2.1 Model Loading with Compatibility Patch

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import DepthwiseConv2D as _OrigDWConv2D

class PatchedDepthwiseConv2D(_OrigDWConv2D):
    """Remove the 'groups' kwarg that older .h5 models may carry."""
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        kwargs.pop("groups", None)
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

CUSTOM_OBJECTS = {"DepthwiseConv2D": PatchedDepthwiseConv2D}
```

#### 12.2.2 Image Enhancement Pipeline

```python
def enhance_image(image):
    """Denoise and normalize camera-captured images."""
    denoised = cv2.bilateralFilter(image, d=5, sigmaColor=50, sigmaSpace=50)
    lab = cv2.cvtColor(denoised, cv2.COLOR_BGR2LAB)
    clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=2.0, tileGridSize=(8, 8))
    lab[:, :, 0] = clahe.apply(lab[:, :, 0])
    enhanced = cv2.cvtColor(lab, cv2.COLOR_LAB2BGR)
    return enhanced
```

#### 12.2.3 Eye Detection with Haar Cascades

```python
def detect_eye(image):
    """Intelligent eye detection with Haar cascades."""
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    gray = cv2.equalizeHist(gray)

    # Strategy 1: Face → Eye ROI
    faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.3, 5)
    if len(faces) > 0:
        fx, fy, fw, fh = max(faces, key=lambda f: f[2] * f[3])
        roi_gray = gray[fy:fy+fh, fx:fx+fw]
        eyes = eye_cascade.detectMultiScale(roi_gray, 1.1, 10)
        # Extract eye crop with padding...

    # Strategy 2: Direct Eye Detection (fallback)
    # Strategy 3: Full Image (last resort)
    return eye_crop, method
```

```python
# Eye/Jaundice Detection
@app.route("/predict/eye", methods=["POST"])

# Face/Skin Disease Detection
@app.route("/predict/face", methods=["POST"])

## 17. Conclusion

**HealthVision AI** successfully demonstrates the application of Deep Learning and Computer Vision in healthcare. The system integrates three distinct disease detection modules — Jaundice (Eye), Skin Disease (Face), and Nail Disease — into a single, accessible web application.

Key achievements of this project include:

- Successful implementation of CNN-based medical image classification models.
- A robust image preprocessing pipeline with enhancement and intelligent region detection.
- A modern, responsive web interface with both upload and camera functionality.
- An integrated AI assistant flow with contextual guidance and hospital follow-up support.
- A comprehensive disease information database providing users with actionable health insights.
- Cloud deployment for universal accessibility.

While the system is not intended to replace professional medical diagnosis, it serves as a valuable preliminary screening tool that can encourage early health awareness and timely medical consultations. The project demonstrates the significant potential of AI in democratizing healthcare access, particularly in underserved communities.
